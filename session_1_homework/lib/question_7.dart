/* Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: 
```dart void main()
  { 
  String name = "Alice"; 
  name = 123; 
  print(name); 
  } 
```
*/

// Answer: Compiler time error because a value of type 'int' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'String' and dart is statically typed.
