// Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.

// answer : because it will give a compiler error : Local variable can't be referenced before it is declared and
// this happens because Dart is statically typed and performs compile-time checks.

// example:

// void main() {
//   value = 10;
//   int value;
// }
